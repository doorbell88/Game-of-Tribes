# Game-of-Tribes
Inspired by Conway's Game of Life -- pits tribes against each other

This is a modification of Conway's Game of Life, in which three Tribes (each of which has its own rules), struggle against each other for survival in a 2D grid.

Put all 4 files in the same directory, and run the gameoflife_tribes.py file in Python.  Most of the time it ends up producing a long, competitive struggle.  Sometimes main players die out in the beginning - if this happens, just run it again.

    Tribe A -- Like a virus.  Has range of sight of 1

    Tribe B -- Like a bacterial sludge.  Has a range of sight of 2

    Tribe C -- Like a multicellular organism.  Has a range of sight of 3
